# COVID-19 Outcome Classifier — Machine Learning with Scikit-learn

This project uses **scikit-learn** to train and evaluate multiple machine learning models on a synthetic COVID-19 dataset.  
It compares several algorithms and visualizes their performance using metrics and decision boundary plots.

Originally developed as part of a **hands-on course project**, this version has been refined and cleaned for public viewing and portfolio use.

## 🧠 Project Overview
The notebook explores how different supervised learning models perform on synthetic COVID-19 data.  
Each model is trained, evaluated, and compared using standard metrics and visualizations.

**Implemented Models**
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Logistic Regression  
- Gradient Descent Classifier (custom implementation)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
